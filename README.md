# time-series-forecasting-ensemble
Read in a time series and fit in it: 1) seasonal regression, 2) seasonal regression + trend, 3) ARIMA, 4) ARIMA with Box-Cox transformation, 5) Holt-Winters multiplicative, 6) Holt-Winters additive, 7) ETS, and 8) TBATS. Use the best model in evaluation against a test set for predicting the value at each "truly out-of-sample" time step.

(still work-in-progress)
